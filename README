HTTP::Headers::UserAgent v3.02

This module is now deprecated. There are other modules which do the same
thing better, and which are actively maintained.

This module is now little more than a wrapper around HTTP::BrowserDetect.
It is provided in case someone out there is using this interface,
but I recommend that you port your code to Parse::HTTP::UserAgent
or HTTP::DetectUserAgent.

A review of Perl modules for parsing User-Agent strings can be found at:
    http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2011/10/cpan-modules-for-parsing-user-agent-strings.html
 
To install this module you should just have to:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

I have taken over maintenance of this module, because these was confusion
over which of the previous releases was the official one. I do not plan
to do further updates, unless there are specific bugs needed,
or clarifications in the documentation.
